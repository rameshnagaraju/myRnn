**Explaination in simple easy way:**

Step 1 — Start with a normal neural network 🍪
A normal neural network is like a vending machine:

You put in a coin (input)

It processes it

And you get a snack (output)
Every time you use it, it forgets what you did before.

If you buy chips now and chocolate later, the machine doesn’t remember what you bought first.

Step 2 — Now give the machine a little memory 🧠
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is like a storytelling machine.

You tell it one word at a time (“Once…” → “upon…” → “a…” → “time…”)

It remembers the earlier words while thinking about the new one.

So it can guess what comes next better!

It has a loop inside:

Takes new input (current word)

Looks at what it remembers from before (hidden state)

Decides output (next word prediction)

Updates its memory for the next step

Step 3 — The magic formula ✨
Think of it like two pipes running together:

Input pipe: New thing you’re telling it now

Memory pipe: What it remembers from before
They get mixed together to decide what happens next.
